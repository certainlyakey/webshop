This is an example task for front end coding a webshop home page (with back end implemented separately with Zend Framework). You can see reference PSD [here](https://github.com/certainlyakey/webshop/blob/master/src/comp.psd) and my work here:

- [CSS/SASS](https://github.com/certainlyakey/webshop/tree/master/code/public/css)
- [JS](https://github.com/certainlyakey/webshop/tree/master/code/public/js)
